# GoLite Compiler

> A lightweight Go dialect with a **self-evolving compiler** — built for experimentation in language design, optimization research, and AI-assisted compilation.

## 🧠 What is GoLite?
GoLite is a research-oriented programming language inspired by Go, paired with an LLVM-based backend that can profile, optimize, and even tune itself over time. It’s a minimal Go-like syntax for fast prototyping, fully LLVM-compatible to compile to native code or WebAssembly, and self-optimizing via evolutionary search that improves compiler flags and passes automatically.

## ✨ Features
- Custom GoLite front-end (Lexer → Parser → AST → Semantic Analysis)  
- Interpreter for quick testing  
- LLVM backend for optimized native code  
- Profile-guided optimization  
- Genetic autotuner that rewrites its optimization strategy over time  
- Pluggable architecture — swap frontends or backends without touching the core pipeline  

## 🔍 Why build GoLite?
This project is ideal if you:
- Want to experiment with new language features without writing a compiler from scratch  
- Need a research testbed for compiler optimization  
- Want to explore AI-assisted compiler design  
- Care about performance tuning for specific workloads or hardware  

## 📦 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Clone and build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSER/golite-compiler.git
cd golite-compiler
make build
2️⃣ Run the interpreter
bash
Copy
Edit
./golite run examples/hello.golite
3️⃣ Compile to native code
bash
Copy
Edit
./golite build examples/fib.golite -o fib
./fib
📜 Example
GoLite Code

go
Copy
Edit
let fib = func(n int) int {
    if n < 2 { return n }
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}

print(fib(10))
Compile & Run

bash
Copy
Edit
golite build fib.golite -o fib
./fib
📊 Autotuning Example
bash
Copy
Edit
golite autotune examples/fib.golite \
    --bench ./benchmarks/fib_bench.sh \
    --iterations 50
